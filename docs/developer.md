# Developing Visallo

This section is intended for those who wish to:

* Contribute code to Visallo
* Create their own Visallo plugins

In order to work with Visallo as a developer, it's recommended that:

* You know Java, since the entire backend is written in Java.
* You know JavaScript, as the UI is very JavaScript heavy.
* You're familiar with common big data tools, including the Hadoop stack, Accumulo.
