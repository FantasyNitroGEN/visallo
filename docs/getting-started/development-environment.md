# Development Environment

The Visallo development environment is very similar across Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux platforms and requires only a few dependencies to get started. In general, the only required dependencies are a [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html), [Maven](https://maven.apache.org), and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). An installation of [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is also required on Mac OS X and Windows but will be installed by Docker Tools if it's not already present on your system. Please see the section below for platform-specific instructions on installing the required dependencies.

## Mac OS X

The `bin/setup-osx-env.sh` script automates much of the development environment installation and setup. The script will prompt you with instructions for the manual steps you'll need to perform.

## Windows

See [Windows Development](windows-development.md)
