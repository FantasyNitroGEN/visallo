# Dependencies

Setting up a Visallo development environment is very similar across Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux platforms and requires only a few dependencies to get started. The only required dependencies to get started are a [Java 8 JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html), [Git](http://git-scm.com/), and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org). Please see the documentation for each respective project for installation instructions.

## Browser Support

Please note that the Visallo UI is primarily developed and tested under Google Chrome, Firefox 38 or later, and IE 11. It may or may not work under other versions or different web browsers.
